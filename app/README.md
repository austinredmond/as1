#A simple, attractive, and easy-to-use fuel consumption tracking app, which maintains a basic log of fuel used for a particular car. 

#A log entry shows the following information:
#    date (entered, yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g., 2016-01-18)
#    station (entered, textual, e.g., Costco)
#    odometer reading (entered in km, numeric to 1 decimal place)
#    fuel grade (entered, textual, e.g., regular)
#    fuel amount (entered in L, numeric to 3 decimal places)
#    fuel unit cost (entered in cents per L, numeric to 1 decimal place)
#    fuel cost (computed, in dollars, to 2 decimal places)

#The app allows the user to:

#    view the log entries (newest addition appearing last)
#    add a new entry (appends to the log)
#    select and edit an existing entry
#    cancel adding or editing an entry
#    see the total overall fuel cost (computed, in dollars, to 2 decimal places), in the view of the log entries
